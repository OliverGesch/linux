Troubleshooting a single kernel configuration
=============================================

This page is a troubleshooting guide enumerating known issues with
single kernel Xenomai configurations.

[TIP]
If running Xenomai 3 over the *Mercury* core, then you are using a
single kernel configuration, and this document was meant for
you. Otherwise, if you are running any release from the Xenomai 2
series, or a Xenomai 3 release using the *Cobalt* real-time core, then
you are using a running kernel configuration, for which you can find
specific
link:troubleshooting-a-dual-kernel-configuration/[troubleshooting information here].
